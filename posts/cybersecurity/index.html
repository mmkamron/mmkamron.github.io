        <p>Cybersecurity careers are one of the fastest-growing and in-demand fields of IT
nowadays. I had no idea about this field before, even if I was interested in
IT. I only came across it when I was watching a video about IT
certifications that help people to get an IT job. And in fact, exams to get
these certifications are not very expensive, have up-to-date topics, and get
people job faster than standard universities in most cases. After some google
search, I found a website called tryhackme, hackthebox and so on. And when I
started to study on these websites, I discovered for myself a whole new field of
cybersecurity. Then I watched videos of professionals in this field and their
views. After some hands-on experience on tryhackme.com, I got really into that.</p>
<p>However, cybersecurity is a very broad field and after some learning, it is important to find your niche. Here are some careers in this field:</p>
<ul>
<li>Red teamer</li>
<li>Blue teamer</li>
<li>Threat hunter</li>
<li>Malware analyst</li>
<li>Application pentester</li>
<li>Security architect and so on</li>
</ul>
<p>There are different roadmaps to achieve what you want. For instance, by having certifications such as security+, OSCP, eJPT and so on, you will have a better chance to get a job in this field. Personally, I have been learning penetration testing by solving capture the flags (CTF), and going through portswigger&rsquo;s web academy to learn more about web vulnerabilities.</p>
<h3 id="edit-160922">Edit 16.09.22</h3>
<p>I realized that it is hard to get an entry-level job as a cybersecurity
specialist. Yes, it is true that this field is still in-demand, but currently,
most companies do not care about securing their infrastructure as much as
building and maintaining it. Also, it became clear to me that without actually having a view
of how the system is built from inside, it is difficult to find a
vulnerability. And people who are new to the field become <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=script%20kiddies">Script kiddies</a> without good knowledge of basics of computing. In most cases, by using latest
versions of frameworks and writing more or less secure code, it is not
difficult to build a secure system. Up until now, I have been reading and practicing the
foundations of computer science and Golang.</p>
